# WiFiNetworkHub
A basic network hub that connects to a WiFi network and provides TCP and UPD ports.

The code is implemented to work with the [Adafruit AirLift board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4201)
or comparable ESP32 board. The code requires that the
[Adafruit fork of the WiFiNINA library](https://github.com/adafruit/WiFiNINA/) be available in your Arduino
library path. The latest version of the WiFiNINA library (from Arduino), is not compatible.

Please see the [basic example](https://github.com/markwomack/WiFiNetworkHub/tree/main/examples/basic) for usage
documentation.

If you have any suggestions or bugs, please [open an issue](https://github.com/markwomack/WiFiNetworkHub/issues).
